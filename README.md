### Overview
The goal of the game is to kill as much dragons as possible while playing this Turn Based Role Playing Game. It starts with two heroes against 4 types of dragons.<br>
The heroes are the Warrior (HP: 130 ATK: 12) and the Mage(HP: 80 ATK: 22). The dragons follows the same 'rule': the more the hp status, the less the damage inflicted.<br>
Once you encounter the enemie, the two enemy dragons will be randomly generated. Each Dragon defeated counts as +10 on your score!<br>
If any of the heroes goes bellow 40HP, it starts dealing double damage. After each fight, both heroes are healed in 12HP.<br>

### Battling
The Game Follows the same old structure as the first released Final Fantasy Games. In the World Map it is not possible to see the enemy encounter zones, which are randomly generated (Also, it's possible to start a game already in a battle if the encounter zone was generated at the Player's initial positioning).<br>
In the Battle, choose the actions and the enemy wisely in order to get the max score!
