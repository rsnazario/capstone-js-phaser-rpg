## Getting Start

#### Get a local copy
Now you need a copy of this application, if you are using Git:
```js
git@github.com:rsnazario/weather-app-js.git
```
Otherwise just hit (Download Zip) on green button (Clone or Download) at top of this page.

#### Run App

Since this project already provides the required files for setting up the Webpack, just type on your terminal:

```js
npm install
````
Now, you can just open your *Visual Studio Code* and click on `Go Live` if you have the `Live Server` extension installed properly. If it requires to select a folder to set as origin, make sure you choose `Dist` folder.

## Testing

After doing the `npm install`, all the the webpack depencies will be installed and with it will come the Jest Library.<br>
The test for this project is only applicable to functions that are not related to Phaser Framework, which leaves us with the task of testing the API connection only.<br>
Running the tests requires a simple use of the npm script, which triggers the Jest tool:
```js
npm test
``` 


### Game Overview
The goal of the game is to kill as much dragons as possible while playing this Turn Based Role Playing Game. It starts with two heroes against 4 types of dragons.<br>
The heroes are the Warrior (HP: 130 ATK: 12) and the Mage(HP: 80 ATK: 22). The dragons follows the same 'rule': the more the hp status, the less the damage inflicted.<br>
Once you encounter the enemies, the two enemy dragons will be randomly generated. Each Dragon defeated counts as +10 on your score!<br>
If any of the heroes goes bellow 40HP, it starts dealing double damage. After each fight, both heroes are healed in 12HP.<br>

### Battling
The Game Follows the same old structure as the first released Final Fantasy Games. In the World Map it is not possible to see the enemy encounter zones, which are randomly generated (Also, it's possible to start a game already in a battle if the encounter zone was generated at the Player's initial positioning).<br>
In the Battle, choose the actions and the enemy wisely in order to get the max score!
